# Pico y Placa

This exercise is done in order to let people know whether they can drive or not in rush hours (in Ecuador) depending on their license plate.

In order to get the program running, is important to first install all the dependencies (by using in the containing folder the command 'npm install'). Then, you can use npm start to open the project in your browser.

It is basically a controlled form where you need to fill:
  * Your license plate number
  * The day you want to drive
  * The time you want to drive

All the testing of errors that might occur are done in the js part of the Form, no other tool was used.

Since I like to try to make independent components, I decided to create different folders for the page and the components that it has (knowing that they weren't a lot, but good practices are good).
